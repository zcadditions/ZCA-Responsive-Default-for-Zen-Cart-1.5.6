# Responsive-Default-for-Zen-Cart-1.5.6
This HTML5 template is mobile friendly and uses Responsive CSS to allow sharing of a single template across multiple device types.  It uses PHP Mobile 
Detect to serve up the optimized layout based on device. It allows the designer to implement device-specific php, jquery, javascript or ajax.
